## **CSE331-AUTOMATA-AND-COMPUTABILITY**
<br>Automata and Computability introduces students to the foundational concepts of formal languages and computational theory. The course delves into various abstract computing models, such as finite automata, pushdown automata, and Turing machines, to explore the capabilities and limitations of computation. The course provides students with the mathematical foundations needed to understand computational processes and develop automated systems like parsers and compilers.Students will also study formal grammars, which are essential for understanding components like compilers. The course emphasizes the importance of mathematical reasoning in analyzing computational problems.</br>
